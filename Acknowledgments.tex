I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Antonella.
Amongst trials and tribulations over the duration of our time working together I was given the utmost support and guidance towards reaching our final goal.
To my closest friend, Eric.
Over the duration of my time at Sussex, we've been ears for one another and springboards for both good and (exceptionally) bad ideas.
To the experimental particle physics group at Sussex, thank you for giving me the opportunity experience forefront research and acting as the launch pad for me to pursue a future in particle physics.
Finally, to my Mum and Dad, Hilda and Steven.
Thank you for always believing in me, encouraging me to do the best I can do, and supporting me even when things seemed to be at their most bleak.
Words do not do justice to the thanks I owe to you both.
