Chapter 1 contains the background information required for this dissertation.
This information was gathered from numerous sources, including online repositories of scientific literature, as well as that gained from discussion with my supervisor and the various doctoral students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Sussex.
Chapter 2 outlines the usage of the software required in this project as I understand it, as well as general information about the ATLAS detector, also gathered from the scientific literature.

The analysis carried out in Chapter 3 was done by myself, and the results my own. 
The signal and background samples were generated using a Monte Carlo simulation, the technicalities of which were handled by one of my supervisor's doctoral students.
The procedure discussed in the analysis is based on the procedure applied in similar analysis routes, with differences and alterations made following discussion with my supervisor.
Various small pieces of code were made for the purpose of this project, often simply to make illustrative aids to the discussion. 
The results included in this dissertation are individual to the analysis, with the quality thereof being discussed towards the end of Chapter 3.
